# JAN 24 TASK - CALL BACK HELL TASK
*********
#### Display countdown from 10 to 1 on the screen and then display "Happy Independence Day" on the screen.

* Here I have created (index.html)file, (Script.js) file, (style.css) file.

* The script to display the countdown and the message on the screen with added colors.
  
* The script to dynamically set the countdown and message on the HTML page, with specified colors for each element. The countdown function is used for a cleaner structure, allowing you to easily modify the appearance of the countdown and message by updating the styles in the HTML file.
